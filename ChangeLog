So far, we do not provide a full version history here. Compared to its
predecessor, NFFT2, the NFFT3 library has seen major extensions and
improvements.

Changes in version 3.1.0:
  - A module, called nfsoft, for fast Fourier transforms on the rotation group 
    SO(3) has been added.
  - It is now possible to configure the build process so that only specific
    modules are compiled and installed. Invoke the configure script with option
    "--help" for details.
  - The handling of how to link against the fftw3 library has been improved. The
    new configure script options "--with-fftw3", "--with-fftw-includedir", and
    "--with-fftw-libdir" allow to specify where fftw3 has been installed.
  - Improved compliance with GNU standards.
  - The experimental Matlab interface has been improved and is now officially a
    part of NFFT3. To compile the Matlab modules, invoke the configure script
    with the option --with-matlab=<path/to/matlab/directory>. Also, an interface
    to the plain NFFT has been added.

Changes in version 3.0.2:
  - Fixed a bug in the fpt module that lead to wrong output.
