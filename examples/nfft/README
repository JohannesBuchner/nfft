List of files and purpose

  README            this file
  simple_test.c     introductory example how to use the nfft
  flags.c           compares different precomputation strategies for the nfft
  flags.m           visualisation with MATLAB, loads data files
                    'flags.data0.gaussian', ... (previously computed by the
                    executable flags (where the window function has to be set
                    and the whole library needs recompilation); calls also the
                    executable taylor_nfft
  ndft_fast.c       compares different precomputation strategies for the ndft
  ndft_fast.m       visualisation with MATLAB, calls the executable ndft_fast
  nfft_benchomp.c   runs benchmarks for nfft OpenMP code and writes results as
                    pgfplots to nfft_benchomp_results_plots.tex, uses
		    nfft_benchomp_createdataset.c and nfft_benchomp_detail.c
  nfft_times.c      compares 1d, 2d, and 3d times to compute nffts and ffts,
                    outputs a latex-table
  taylor_nfft.c     compares the nfft with a taylor expansion based one
  taylor_nfft.m     visualisation with MATLAB, calls the executable taylor_nfft
