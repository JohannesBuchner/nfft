NFFT3 - Nonequispaced FFT, generalisations, inversion, and applications

Overview
--------
NFFT3 is a software library written in C for computing nonequispaced fast Fourier  
and related transformations. In detail, NFFT3 implements

 1) The nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT)
    - the forward transform (NFFT)
    - the adjoint transform (adjoint NFFT)
 2) Generalisations of the NFFT
    - to arbitrary knots in time and frequency domain (NNFFT)
    - to the sphere S^2 (NFSFT)
    - to the hyperbolic cross (NSFFT)
    - to real-valued data, i.e. (co)sine transforms, (NFCT, NFST)
    - to the rotation group (NFSOFT)
 3) Generalised inverses based on iterative methods, e.g. CGNR, CGNE 
 4) Applications in
    - medical imaging
         (i) magnetic resonance imaging
        (ii) computerised tomography
    - summation schemes
          (i) fast Gauss transform (FGT)
         (ii) singular kernels
        (iii) zonal kernels
    - polar FFT, discrete Radon transform, ridgelet transform

For an introduction, please read the "NFFT 3.0 - Tutorial" first. It is 
available in the subdirectory doc/tutorial/tutorial.pdf. Detailed API 
documentation can be found in HTML format in /doc/api/html/index.html
or in LaTeX format for self compilation in /doc/api/latex/refman.tex.
For installation instructions, you can also refer to the file INSTALL
in this directory.

The most current general paper, and the one that we recommend if you wish 
to cite NFFT, is: The paper by Keiner, J., Kunis, S., and Potts, D. 
''Using NFFT 3 - a software library for various nonequispaced fast Fourier transforms'' 
ACM Trans. Math. Software, accepted.
