This directory contains third party code that is needed to build NFFT3. This 
directory does, however, not contain the FFTW3 library which is also needed to 
build NFFT3. It is available from http://www.fftw.org as a free download. All 
code in subpackages is copyright of the respective authors as stated in each
package. Currently, the following packages are included:

CSTRIPACK - A C-version of Robert J. Renka's the STRIPACK Fortran package to
