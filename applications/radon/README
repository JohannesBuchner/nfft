radon - Fast discrete NFFT-based Radon transform

  This folder includes simple C programs (radon.c, inverse_radon.c) for the
  computation of a fast discrete NFFT-based Radon transform and its inverse.
  Use the Matlab script file radon.m for a simple demonstration.

  The Matlab script file ridgelet.m contains an example of denoising by hard
  thresholding the discrete ridgelet coefficients of a noisy image. The
  discrete ridgelet transform is based on the fast discrete NFFT-based Radon
  transform.
