Field Inhomogeneity Correction based on Gridding Reconstruction for Magnetic Resonance Imaging

by H. Eggers, Tobias Knopp, and Daniel Potts

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Open MATLAB and run the script file mri.m or mri_inh.m.
mri.m and mri_inh are an examples for the usage of the programs.
mri.m uses a simple model without considering  a field inhomogenity
against what mri_inh.m considers the field inhomogeneity
