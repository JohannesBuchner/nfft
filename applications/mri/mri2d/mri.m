% This script file is an example of the usage

% Construct the raw data of the phantom
% and write it to input_f.dat
% To use another example than the phantom
% just put the reshape of your example into input_data_f.dat
output = reshape(phantom(N),1,N*N);
save input_f.dat -ascii output

% Construct the knots in k-space and write them to knots.dat
% Different knots like spiral,rose,radial or linogram can be chosen
% M is the number of knots
M = construct_knots_spiral(N,1);

% Make a 2d-NFFT on the constructed knots
% and write the output to output_data_phantom_nfft.dat
system(['./construct_data_2d ' 'output_phantom_nfft.dat ' ...

% Precompute the weights using voronoi cells
% and write them to weights.dat
precompute_weights('output_phantom_nfft.dat',M);

% Make an inverse 2d-NFFT
% and write the output to output_real.dat and output_imag.dat
% The usage is "./reconstruct_data_2 filename N M ITER WEIGHTS"
% where ITER is the number of iteration and WEIGHTS is 1
% if the weights are used 0 else
